# Frequently Asked Questions
Below are some frequently asked questions that we expect to answer, or have already been asked:

## Is only Mikrotik supported?
Original proof-of-concept code was made to support Mikrotik networks, but it's in the process of being expanded to support other platforms.

## What platforms can this run on?
It runs on Linux and Windows with Python 2.7 installed. Python PIP is required to install the needed modules in the [requirements.txt](./Install/requirements.txt) installation file.

## Do you have a pre-configured VM image I can use?
No, we do not provide a pre-configured VM image. See the following pre-built Ubuntu Server sources:

- Ubuntu Server in [Amazon's AWS Marketplace from Canonical](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=565feec9-3d43-413e-9760-c651546613f2)
- Install media for Ubuntu Server from Canonical's [Ubuntu Server download page](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server).

**Note**: Only download installation media or server images from trusted vendor and developer sources.
